C-Sharp-CraigslistJobSearcher
=============================

Searches Craigslist for jobs on craigslist that suit my skills and experience

Craigslist doesn't have a great API. Instead they use rss 1.0. Ugh. So I parsed it all and got all the info I needed.
I used iTextSharp PDF to dynamically create Cover Letters to send to future employers.
Then, I can send those employers my new cover letter and my resume.
