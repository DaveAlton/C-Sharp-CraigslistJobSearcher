C# Craigslist Job Searcher
=============================

Searches Craigslist for jobs on craigslist that suit my skills and experience and then writes a PDF cover letter outlining my matching skills. I've never used this though, it's too impersonal. Created in 9 hours just for fun!

Craigslist doesn't have a great API. Instead they use rss 1.0. Ugh. So I parsed it all and got all the info I needed.
I used iTextSharp PDF to dynamically create Cover Letters to send to future employers.
Then, I can send those employers my new cover letter and my resume.
